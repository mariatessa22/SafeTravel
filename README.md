# SafeTravel
In today’s fast-paced technological world, innovation makes life easier and accessible.

What about those who face daily challenges in mobility and independence, especially  the visually impaired?
  
Goal - To develop an accessible app/website that assists visually impaired individuals to navigate and travel safely.


Our project, aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals in navigating and traveling safely, aligns with-
:​
UN SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, which focuses on empowering and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all individuals, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status.​
UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.
